7) If you are to start a software company, Naveen Naik and Swaroop are 2 people from my batch I will choose as partners. They are dedicated to work and determined. The approach of problem solving is different than others in
my batch. They participated in National Level CTFs and Coding Contests. They have good understanding on the IT 
software development work. They can learn things fast. I collaborated with them in one of the contest like they 
are awesome guys that I ever seen before. Logic Building , step by step problem solving. They both worked in a 
startup they know the internal things how will they work. I am sure they are the best match for me.
